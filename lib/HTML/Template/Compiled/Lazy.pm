=head1 NAME

HTML::Template::Compiled::Lazy - Lazy Loading for HTML::Template::Compiled

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use HTML::Template::Compiled::Lazy;
    my $htcl = HTML::Template::Compiled::Lazy->new(
        # usual parameters for HTML::Template::Compiled
    );
    $htcl->param(...);
    # file wasn't compiled yet
    print $htcl->output; # now compile and output!

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class does not compile templates before calling C<output()>.
This includes C<TMPL_INCLUDE>s. This can be useful in CGI environments.
If your template has got a lot of includes L<HTML::Template::Compiled> will
compile all of them, even if they aren't needed because they are never
reached (in a C<TMPL_IF>, for example).

L<HTML::Template::Compiled::Lazy> also won't complain if the file does
not exist - it will complain when you call C<output()>, though.
